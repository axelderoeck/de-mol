## Background
This web application is based on a Belgian TV game show called 'De Mol' [^1]. The show revolves around a group of people earning as much money as possible with challenges, all while finding the 1 mole whose task is to sabotage the challenges. Every episode there is a test with questions about the mole. The candidate who has the weakest test result has to go home. The last 2 candidates have to fight for the best test result about the mole in order to win.

## The Web App [^2]

The goal of this web application is to play along with the tv show. You start out with **10** points, then you have to submit these points to the candidates you find the most suspicious. 'Molboek' is your weekly overview of your votes. On the scores page u can compare your score with everyone, friends and groups to see who is the best detective.

After the episode airs, you will get a screen [^3] that displays your results.
If you voted on a candidate that had to go home this episode, you will have a **red screen** and lose those points. However if u voted correctly u will get a **green screen** and those points will be doubled.

>**:pencil2: Example**
>- Lennart: 8pts
>- Dami: 2pts
>
>Dami had to go home this episode, this means I lose those 2 points.
>But my points on Lennart are still correct, that means I get double the amount back = 16pts total.
